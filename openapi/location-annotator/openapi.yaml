    # Introduction

    A location annotator takes as input a clinical note and outputs a list of
    predicted location annotations found in the clinical note. This OpenAPI
    document describes the specification of the NLP Sandbox Location Annotator
    API. This specification includes the schemas of the input and output data,
    and the requirements that this annotator must meet if you want to benchmark
    its performance on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io).

    # Getting Started

    The GitHub repository
    [nlpsandbox/location-annotator-example](https://github.com/nlpsandbox/location-annotator-example)
    provides an example implementation of the NLP Sandbox Location Annotator API
    in Python-Flask. By the end of the tutorial available in the README, you
    will have built a Docker image for this NLP Sandbox tool. You will then be
    able to submit this image to [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io) to
    benchmark its performance.

    # Benchmarking Requirements

    Your NLP Sandbox tool must meet the following requirements before evaluating
    its performance on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io).

    - The endpoint `/` must redirect to `/api/v1/tool`.

    - The endpoint `/ui` must redirect to the Swagger User Interface (UI).

    - The output of this tool must be reproducible: a given input should always
      generate the same output.

    - To ensure the results are reproducible and robust, and the data are
      secured, this tool must not connect to any remote server. When benchmarked
      on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io), this tool will not be able to
      connect to remote servers.
