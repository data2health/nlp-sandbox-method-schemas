    # Introduction

    A COVID Symptom Annotator takes as input a clinical note and outputs a list
    of predicted COVID-19 sign and symptom annotations found in the clinical
    note. This OpenAPI document describes the specification of a COVID Symptom
    Annotator. This specification includes the schemas of the input and output
    data, and the conditions that this annotator must meet if you want to
    benchmark its performance on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io).

    # Getting Started

    The GitHub repository
    [nlpsandbox/covid-symptom-annotator-example](https://github.com/nlpsandbox/covid-symptom-annotator-example)
    provides a simple example implementation of a Python-Flask COVID Symptom
    Annotator. By the end of the tutorial available in the README, you will have
    built a Docker image for a simple COVID Symptom Annotator. You will then be
    able to submit this image to [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io) to
    benchmark its performance.

    # Benchmarking Requirements

    Your NLP Sandbox tool must meet the following conditions before evaluating
    its performance on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io).

    - The endpoint `/` must redirect to `/api/v1/tool`.

    - The endpoint `/ui` must redirect to the web interface (UI).

    - The output of this tool must be reproducible: a given input should always
      generate the same output.

    - To ensure the results are reproducible and robust, and the data are
      secured, this tool must not connect to any remote server. When benchmarked
      on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io), this tool will not be able to
      connect to remote servers.
