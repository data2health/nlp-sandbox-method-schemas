    # Introduction

    A COVID symptom annotator takes as input a clinical note and outputs a list
    of predicted COVID-19 sign and symptom annotations found in the clinical
    note. This OpenAPI document describes the specification of the NLP Sandbox
    COVID Symptom Annotator API. This specification includes the schemas of the
    input and output data, and the requirements that this annotator must meet if
    you want to benchmark its performance on
    [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io).

    # Getting Started

    The GitHub repository
    [nlpsandbox/covid-symptom-annotator-example](https://github.com/nlpsandbox/covid-symptom-annotator-example)
    provides an example implementation of the NLP Sandbox COVID Symptom
    Annotator API in Python-Flask. By the end of the tutorial available in the
    README, you will have built a Docker image for this NLP Sandbox tool. You
    will then be able to submit this image to
    [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io) to benchmark its performance.

    # Benchmarking Requirements

    Your NLP Sandbox tool must meet the following requirements before evaluating
    its performance on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io).

    - The endpoint `/` must redirect to `/api/v1/tool`.

    - The endpoint `/ui` must redirect to the Swagger User Interface (UI).

    - The output of this tool must be reproducible: a given input should always
      generate the same output.

    - To ensure the results are reproducible and robust, and the data are
      secured, this tool must not connect to any remote server. When benchmarked
      on [nlpsandbox.io](https://nlpsandbox.io), this tool will not be able to
      connect to remote servers.
